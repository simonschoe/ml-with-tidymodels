## Contents

This 4 hour workshop gives a deep insight into `tidymodels`, a unified framework towards modeling and machine learning in `R` using tidy data principles. Participants will get to know tools that facilitate every step of the machine learning workflow, from resampling, over feature engineering and model building, to model tuning and performance evaluation.

More specifically, after this workshop the participants will
- be familiar with the core packages of the `tidymodels` ecosystem and hopefully realize the value of a unified modeling framework,
- know how to design a full-fledged machine learning pipeline for a particular prediction task,
- broaden their technical skill set by learning about declarative programming, hyperparameter scales and parallel processing, and
- most importantly, be capable of conducting their own machine learning projects in `R`.
