## Contents

This lecture gives a deep insight into `tidymodels`, a unified framework towards modeling and machine learning in `R` using tidy data principles. It introduces and motivates tools that facilitate every step of the machine learning workflow, from resampling, over preprocessing and model building, to model tuning and performance evaluation.

More specifically, after this lecture you will
- be familiar with the core packages of the `tidymodels` ecosystem and hopefully realize the value of a unified modeling framework,
- know how to design a full-fledged machine learning pipeline for a particular prediction task,
- broaden your technical skills by learning about declarative programming, hyperparameter scales and parallel processing, and
- most importantly, be capable of conducting your own machine learning projects in `R`.
