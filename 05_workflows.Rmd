## 4.4 `workflows`: Modeling Workflows

`workflows` introduces a `workflow` object which bundles the preprocessing recipe and model specification to reduce code clatter. At the same time, it acts as a single entry point to your modeling pipeline.

```{r}
cls_wf <- workflow(preprocessor = mod_recipe, spec = log_cls)
cls_wf
```

.pull-right[.pull-right[.footnote[
*Note: You may even bundle (and later explore) various different combinations of preprocessing recipes and model specifications using the `workflowsets` package.*
]]]

???
- if no preprocessing is required (because the data is already perfect) `add_formula()` could be used (but you can only ever use one of the two)
- in later releases, `workflows` should also be able to encapsulate post-processing steps (e.g., modifying the probability cutoff for binary classification; or calibration of probabilities; or determination of euqivocal zones)

## 4.4 `workflows`: Modeling Workflows

When calling `fit()` on a `workflow` object, `tidymodels` performs the following steps for us:
1. It fits the `recipe` object to the training set and produces the in-sample estimates (`prep()`).
2. It applies the fitted recipe to the training set to process the predictors (`bake()`).
3. It trains the specified model on the transformed training set (`fit()`/`fit_xy()`).

```{r, results='hide'}
cls_wf_fit <- cls_wf %>% 
  fit(train_set)

cls_wf_fit
```
```

```

???
- workflows abstract away the need for `prep` and `bake`

## 4.4 `workflows`: Modeling Workflows

Again, after having fitted the workflow, we can proceed to predicting the response in the test data. When calling `predict()` on a `workflow` object, `tidymodels` performs the following steps for us:
1. It applies the fitted recipe to the test set to process the predictors (`bake()`).
2. It applies the trained model to the preprocessed test set predictors to generate predictions (`predict()`).

```{r}
cls_wf_fit %>% 
  predict(new_data = test_set, type = "prob") %>% 
  glimpse
```

.footnote[
*Note: Call `extract_fit_engine()` or `extract_recipe()` to extract the fitted model or the estimated `recipe` object from the workflow.*

## Tidymodels: A Complete Example

**Step 1:** Split data into training and test set using `rsample`.
```{r}
set.seed(2021)
climbers_split <- initial_split(climbers_df, prop = 0.8, strata = died)

train_set <- training(climbers_split)
test_set  <- testing(climbers_split)
```

**Step 2:** Define the relevant preprocessing steps using `recipe`.
```{r}
rec <- recipe(formula = died ~ ., data = train_set) %>%
  update_role(member_id, new_role = "id") %>%
  step_impute_median(age) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
  step_other(peak_name, citizenship, expedition_role, threshold = 0.05) %>%
  step_dummy(all_predictors(), -all_numeric(), one_hot = F) %>%
  themis::step_upsample(died, over_ratio = 0.2, seed = 2021, skip = T)
```

**Step 3:** Specify the desired machine learning model using `parsnip`.
```{r}
log_cls <- logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glm") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")
```

## Tidymodels: A Complete Example

**Step 4:** Bring everything together using `workflows`.
```{r}
cls_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(rec) %>%
  add_model(log_cls)
```

**Step 5:** Train the workflow (i.e. recipe plus model) and use it for prediction.
```{r}
cls_wf_fit <- cls_wf %>%
  fit(train_set)

cls_wf_fit %>% 
  predict(new_data = test_set, type = "prob") %>% 
  glimpse
```
