## 1 Learning Objectives 💡

This workshop introduces `tidymodels`, a unified framework towards modeling and machine learning in `R` using tidy data principles. You will get to know tools that facilitate every step of your machine learning workflow, from resampling, over feature engineering and model building, to model tuning and performance evaluation.

More specifically, after this workshop you will
- be familiar with the core packages of the `tidymodels` ecosystem and hopefully realize the value of a unified modeling framework,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- know how to design a full-fledged machine learning pipeline for a particular prediction task,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- broaden your technical skill set by learning about declarative programming, hyperparameter scales and parallel processing, and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- most importantly, be capable of conducting your own machine learning projects in `R`.

&gt; Whenever possible, the software should be able to protect users from committing mistakes. Software should make it easy for users to do the right thing. ~ [Kuhn/Silge (2021)](https://www.tmwr.org/software-modeling.html#software-modeling)

???
- a framework for modeling (guardrails) using using tidy data principles
- very similar to the unified `scikit-learn` package in the context of `Python`
- by the way, this is general a central distinction between R and Python: Python advocates the paradigm of having one unified approach for every problem (which makes it at times also less flexible)

**`tidymodels` core packages:**
- `rsample`: general methods for resampling
- `recipes`: unified interface to data preprocessing
- `parsnip`: unified interface to modeling
- `workflows`: combine model blueprints and preprocessing recipes
- `dials`: create tuning parameters
- `tune`: hyperparameter tuning
- `broom`: tidy model outputs
- `yardstick`: model evaluation

???
- tidymodels can be viewed as another meta-package that shares the design philosophy, grammar and data structures of the tidyverse
- each package has its own goal which makes tidymodels a modular collection of package
- A goal of the tidymodels packages is that the interfaces to common tasks are standardized
- we will discuss each package along the modeling workflow: resampling, preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation

```

???
Explain:
- very similar when you load the whole tidyverse
- as you can see tidymodels loads also some of the tidyverse packages (however, usually you would load both at the beginning of your R session) -&gt; this means that some tidymodels functions also use dplyr, purrr and ggplot2 functionality
- again we have some conflicts here, so these functions override functions by the base `R` `stats` package
- `tidymodels v0.1.4`: relatively new package ecosystem, it is not unlikely that some of the features or function interfaces will change slightly in the future

## 2 Introduction to `tidymodels`

Remember, modeling is one of the main steps in our day-2-day data science workflow. And this is precisely where `tidymodels` fits in!

- Tidytuesday: social project to motivate the R online community to learn working with tools like ggplot2, dplyr and tidyr and applying them to real-world data
- around 50 different data sets right now
- this dataset consists of three different csv files

---

## 3 Himalayan Climbing Expeditions Data

The data set contains a large record of data spanning the 1905-2019 period about
- 🏔 the several **peaks** of the mountain range,
- 🐾 the conducted **expeditions** during this period, and
- 🧗‍♀️ the **members** of each expedition.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Task:** Predict the likelihood of an expedition coming to a lethal end (i.e. *binary classification task*).


```r
tt_data$members %&gt;% 
  skimr::skim()
```

???
- Motivations for the task: derive drivers for a successful expedition and eventually reduce death rates.
- use `skimr` package to get a high-level view of the data and most important descriptives

**Pt. 1:**
- total of 76,519 expedition members
- categorization of data types

**Pt. 2:**
- three id columns, these are likely not supposed to end up in any predictive model -&gt; in any case, if you have an id variable with predictive value you should question in the data generating process behind the id column
- 391 different peaks, but only 390 different peak names
- with 76,519 climbers, almost 1000 died (75,413 non-death causes), and another 600 came back injured (74,807 non-injured) -&gt; imbalanced prediction task
- 524 different expedition roles
- why do we have five seasons? (probably an unknown category)

**Pt. 3:**
logical:
- never missing
- `hired` natives (around 20% of the expedition members)
- only 38% expeditions made it to the top (`success`)
- likely we can have expeditions that were successful, but where one or several member died
- died and injured corresponds to the numbers of `death_cause` and `injury_type`

**Pt. 4:**
numeric:
- hist of `year` expeditions took place more and more often in the two recent decades
- `age`: most climbers i would expect to be between 20-40, with few very old climbers (85), and some super young (7?!)
- `age` and `highpoint_metres` has a lot of missings!

usually, you would do a lot more EDA right now:
- plot of expedition year against success/failure rates -&gt; more recent expeditions likely more successful as you know more about the region/have better equipment
- plot of age against success/failure rates -&gt; younger, more athletic climbers more successful?
- check which peaks or seasons are most associated with climber deaths
- check if oxygen use is associated with death rates
- good practice is always to do a correlation matrix

## 4.1 `rsample`: Resampling Infrastructure

`rsample` provides a set of methods for **data partitioning** (i.e. splitting the data into training and test set) and **resampling** (i.e. drawing repeated samples from the training set to obtain the sampling distribution of a given statistic).

&lt;br&gt;

--

First, let's partition our data into a training and test set via `initial_split()`. The resulting `rsplit` object indexes the original data points according to their data set membership.

```r
set.seed(2021)
climbers_split &lt;- initial_split(climbers_df, prop = 0.8, strata = died)

- for imbalanced samples, random sample can lead to catastrophic model
- strata: conduct a stratified split -&gt; keep proportions (i.e. imbalance) in training as well as in test set -&gt; since sampling is random it might otherwise be case that sampling creates an even severer or slighter imbalance
- with regression problems, stratified samples can be drawn based on a binned outcome (e.g., quartiles)
- indexing is more memory efficient

## 4.1 `rsample`: Resampling Infrastructure

Since we want to implement classifiers that contain hyperparameters we require a three-way data split:
- The **Training Set**, which is used for model training (i.e. estimating model coefficients).
- The **Validation Set**, which is used for parameter tuning (i.e. finding optimal hyperparameters).
- The **Test Set**, which is used for computing a robust estimate of model performance.

Data sets:
- training to optimize model coefs, validation to optimize hyperparameters (as part of model tuning as well as feature engineering), test to evaluate the model
- refit the optimal model on training and validation set and evaluate on the test set
- i prefer the terms training and validation instead of analysis and assessment set in the context of resampling (often test, validation and hold-out set are used interchangeably)

CV vs. train-test-split:
- we usually prefer the latter as we would like to generate a distribution of our error measure and to account for uncertainty in the estimate

## 4.1 `rsample`: Resampling Infrastructure

**Alternative resampling approaches:** In conjunction to `\(k\)`-fold CV, `rsample` enables various alternative resampling schemes for producing an unbiased estimate of model performance.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Repeated k-fold CV]
For `repeats &gt; 1`, `vfold_cv()` repeats the CV approach to reduce the standard error of the estimate at the cost of higher computational demand ( `\(k∗R\)` folds).

```r
set.seed(2021)

train_set %&gt;%
  vfold_cv(v = 10, repeats = 2, strata = died)
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[The Bootstrap]
`bootstraps()` conducts sampling with replacement whereby model performance is estimated based on the "out-of-bag" observations.

```r
set.seed(2021)

train_set %&gt;%
  bootstraps(times = 25, strata = died)
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Monte Carlo CV (MCCV)]
`mc_cv()` lies somewhere in between `\(k\)`-fold CV and the bootstraps since it enables partly overlapping assessment sets (i.e. folds consist of bootstrapped samples).

```r
set.seed(2021)

train_set %&gt;% 
  mc_cv(prop = 0.9, times = 25, strata = died)
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Time-Series Resampling]
&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fXZ6k.png" width="40%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /&gt;

For temporally correlated data `rsample` provides a suitable partitioning and resampling infrastructure as well.

For example, use `initial_time_split()` to conduct a non-random early-late-split and `rolling_origin()` or the `slide_*()` methods to generate time-series resamples.

???
- repeated CV: reduces validation set error independent of the way the folds were resampled -&gt; increases computational demand -&gt; i have simply more estimates for the validation set error that I can average
- MC CV: creates 25 bootsrapped folds with 90% training and 10% test data, whereby test sets can overlap due to sampling with replacement
- with time-dependent data, random sampling can lead to disastrous models
- data partitioning and resampling should always be implemented by accounting for the future use of the trained model (how is the newly arriving data distributed?)

## 4.2 `recipes`: Preprocessing Tools

&gt; In statistics, a **design matrix** (also known as **regressor matrix** or **model matrix**) is a matrix of values of explanatory variables of a set of objects, often denoted by `\(X\)`. Each row represents an individual object, with the successive columns corresponding to the variables and their specific values for that object. ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_matrix)

&lt;br&gt;

--

Every model in `R` requires a design matrix as input. Intuitively, we can think of a design matrix as a tidy data frame (with one observation per row and one predictor per column) which can be directly processed by the model function.

--

Oftentimes, however, data frames or matrices that we apply to a model function do not come in the required format. For example:
- A linear model requires categorical predictors to be (one-hot) encoded as `\(C-1\)` binary dummies.
- In contrast, a decision tree can deal with categorical predictors.
- A support vector machine performs best with standardized predictors.
- And numerous models reject missing values in their model matrix.

.footnote[
*Note: Some functions internally convert a data frame to a numeric design matrix (e.g., `lm()` automatically one-hot encodes unordered factors and creates polynomial contrasts from ordered factors).*
]

???
Most R functions create the design matrix automatically from a given data frame according to the formula that is provided in the function call.

## 4.2 `recipes`: Preprocessing Tools

The `recipes` package provides functions for defining a **blueprint for data preprocessing** (aka *feature engineering*). Each `recipe` is constructed by chaining multiple preprocessing steps.

--

First, create a `recipe` object from your data using the `recipe()` function and the two arguments:
- `formula`: A formula to declare variable roles, i.e. everything on the left-hand side (LHS) of the `~` is declared as `outcome` and everything on the right-hand side (RHS) as `predictor`.
- `data`: The data to which the feature engineering steps are later applied. The data set is only used to catalogue the variables and their respective types (which is why you generally provide the training set).


```r
mod_recipe &lt;- recipe(formula = died ~ ., data = train_set)
mod_recipe
```

```
&gt; Recipe
&gt; 
&gt; Inputs:
&gt; 
&gt;       role #variables
&gt;    outcome          1
&gt;  predictor         12
```

---

## 4.2 `recipes`: Preprocessing Tools

Second, we add new preprocessing steps to the recipe (using the family of `step_*()` functions):

- Use `update_role()` to assign a new custom role to a predictor. As `member_id` simply enumerates our observations, it is assigned the `"id"` role and hence not considered in any downstream modeling task.


```r
mod_recipe &lt;- mod_recipe %&gt;% update_role(member_id, new_role = "id")
mod_recipe
```

```
&gt; Recipe
&gt; 
&gt; Inputs:
&gt; 
&gt;       role #variables
&gt;         id          1
&gt;    outcome          1
&gt;  predictor         11
```

.pull-right[.pull-right[.footnote[
&lt;i&gt;Note: Change the role of a predictor to keep it in the data, however, without being used during model fitting. Usually `step_*()` functions do not change the role of a predictor. However, each `step_*()` function contains a `role` argument to explicitly specify the role of a newly generated predictor.&lt;/i&gt;
]]]

???
- with the `new_role` argument I can set any custom role name

---

## 4.2 `recipes`: Preprocessing Tools

Second, we add new preprocessing steps to the recipe (using the family of `step_*()` functions):

- Use `step_impute_median()` to impute `NA` values by the median predictor value. Since roughly 3,500 missing values are inherent to `age`, we use median-imputation to retain those observations.


```r
mod_recipe &lt;- mod_recipe %&gt;% step_impute_median(age)
mod_recipe
```

```
&gt; Recipe
&gt; 
&gt; Inputs:

- essence of recipes: the steps are only declared and not directly executed!
- we are constructing a blueprint which we can later apply in one go to our data

---

## 4.2 `recipes`: Preprocessing Tools

Second, we add new preprocessing steps to the recipe (using the family of `step_*()` functions):

- Use `step_normalize()` to scale numerical data to zero mean and unit standard deviation (which is required for scale-sensitive classifiers).


```r
mod_recipe &lt;- mod_recipe %&gt;% step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())
mod_recipe

## 4.2 `recipes`: Preprocessing Tools

Second, we add new preprocessing steps to the recipe (using the family of `step_*()` functions):

- Use `step_other()` to lump together rarely occurring factor levels. `peak_name`, `citizenship` and `expedition_role` all have several 100 factor levels and hence a high risk of being near-zero variance features. All factor levels with a relative frequency below 5% are pooled into `"other"`.


```r

## Excursus: Imperative vs. Declarative Programming

Up to this point, you have not performed any actual preprocessing respectively transformation of your data - you have only sketched a blueprint of what `R` is supposed to do with your data.

The difference between instantly executing a command and declaring it, in case it is prospectively needed, relates to two important programming paradigms:
- **Imperative programming:** A command is entered and immediately executed (what you are likely used to do in `R` so far).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- **Declarative programming:** A command is specified, along with some important constraints, however, the execution of the code occurs at later point in time, either specified by the user or the program (which you have to get used to when working with machine learning tools, e.g., `tidymodels`).

## 4.2 `recipes`: Preprocessing Tools

Third, `prep()` fits the recipe to the dataset specified in your [initial `recipe` call](#recipe-call) in order to estimate the unknown quantities required for preprocessing (e.g., medians or pooled factor levels).


```r
mod_recipe_prepped &lt;- prep(mod_recipe, retain = T)
mod_recipe_prepped
```

```
&gt; Recipe
&gt; 
&gt; Inputs:
&gt; 
&gt;       role #variables
&gt;         id          1
&gt;    outcome          1
&gt;  predictor         11
&gt; 
&gt; Training data contained 61176 data points and 2767 incomplete rows. 
&gt; 
&gt; Operations:
&gt; 
&gt; Median Imputation for age [trained]
&gt; Centering and scaling for year, age [trained]
&gt; Collapsing factor levels for peak_name, citizenship, expedition_role [trained]
&gt; Dummy variables from peak_name, season, sex, citizenship, expedition_role, hired, so... [trained]
&gt; Up-sampling based on died [trained]
```

???
- other unknown quantities: means and sd for scaling, new data points for upsampling
- retain saves the preprocessed data set (here the training data)
  - do this to avoid unnecessary recomputation each time you fit a model
  - don't do this if your working with really big data
- see in the output that the steps are now `[trained]`; output also shows results of the selectors

## Excursus: Data Leakage 💧

By applying `prep()` to the final recipe, we fit the recipe only to the training set (as specified in the `recipe()` function above). Thus, we prevent the issue of data leakage!

.pull-left[
**The data leakage issue:**
- Information from outside the training set (i.e. the test set) leak into the model training step.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- The result is an over-optimistic model that performs extremely well on the test set as it has already seen some of the test samples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- It likely occurs when computations are performed over the whole data instead of just the training set.

Practical example from fastbook ch. 9: 
A real-life business intelligence project at IBM where potential customers for certain products were identified, among other things, based on keywords found on their websites. This turned out to be leakage since the website content used for training had been sampled at the point in time where the potential customer has already become a customer, and where the website contained traces of the IBM products purchased, such as the word 'Websphere' (e.g., in a press release about the purchase or a specific product feature the client uses).

## 4.2 `recipes`: Preprocessing Tools

&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/recipes.png" width="65%" height="65%" style="float:right; padding=10px" /&gt;

**Benefits of using recipes:**
- Recycle preprocessing blueprints across multiple model candidates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Extended scope of preprocessing relative to the use of formula expressions (`y ~ x`).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Compact syntax due to the various selector helpers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- The preprocessing steps are encapsulated into a single object instead of being scattered across the `R` script.

## 4.2 `recipes`: Preprocessing Tools

Altogether, the `recipes` package offers a variety of built-in preprocessing steps:

```
&gt;  [1] "step_arrange"            "step_bagimpute"          "step_bin2factor"         "step_BoxCox"

```

In addition, you may also include checks in your pipeline to test for a specific condition of your variables:

```
&gt; [1] "check_class"      "check_cols"       "check_missing"    "check_name"      
&gt; [5] "check_new_values" "check_range"      "check_type"
```

]

???
- `step_date`: converts a date into factor variables, e.g., day of the week or month
- `step_holiday`: creates a dummy for a national holiday
- `step_corr`: removes variables that have large absolute correlations with other variables
- `step_normalize`: applies z-Transformation to predictors
- `step_mutate`: to engineer new variables (analogue to `dplyr`)
- `step_interact`: to create interaction effects
- `step_log`: create the log of a given variable (either outcome or predictor)
- `step_indicate_na`: own predictor for missing values

-&gt; basically, all transformation steps you would do using dplyr before modeling, respectively all steps that the model formula would enforce can be embedded as a recipe step within your modeling workflow

## 4.3 `parsnip`: A Unified Modeling API

**Different models, different packages**

The `R` ecosystem offers a plethora of different packages for implementing machine learning models: `stats::lm`, `stats::glm`, `MASS::lda`, `class::knn`, `glmnet::glmnet`, `rpart::rpart`, `randomForest::randomForest`, `gbm::gbm`, `e1071::svm`, etc.

It is very likely that you will struggle with the varying naming conventions, function interfaces and syntactical intricacies of each package.

**Same models, different packages**

The same issue persists if you try to implement one and the same model using alternative packages.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[randomForest]
- **Number of predictors:** mtry
- **Number of trees:** ntree
- **Number of split points:** nodesize

- **Number of trees:** num.trees
- **Number of split points:** min.node.size

.panel[.panel-name[sparklyr]
- **Number of predictors:** feature_subset_strategy
- **Number of trees:** num_trees
- **Number of split points:** min_instances_per_node
]

???
- spark is an alternative programming language
- often machine learning methods are implemented in C++ due to superior speed and a R frontend is put on top of the C++ implementation
- note: this heterogeneity can be observed across the whole modeling landscape in R (e.g., also each package has its own `predict()` functions with slightly differing naming conventions)

`parsnip` provides a **unified interface** and syntax to modeling which facilitates your overall modeling workflow. The goals of `parsnip` are twofold:
1. Decoupling model definition from model fitting and model evaluation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2. Harmonizing function arguments (e.g., `ntree`, `num.trees` and `num_trees` become `trees` or `k` becomes `neighbors`)


???
- the goal is to make function arguments more expressive (`neighbor` instead of `k`, `penalty` instead of `lambda`)
- in `parsnip`: `trees`

&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/parsnip.png" width="60%" height="60%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /&gt;

A `parsnip` model specification is always made up of three individual components:
- **Type:** The model type that is about to be fitted (e.g., linear/logit regression, random forest or SVM).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- **Mode:** The mode of prediction, i.e. regression or classification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- **Engine:** The computational engine implemented in `R` which usually corresponds to a certain modeling function (`lm`, `glm`,) package (e.g., `rpart`, `glmnet`, `randomForest`) or computing framework (e.g., `Stan`, `sparklyr`).

⚠️ **Notice that we did not apply any of our predefined preprocessing steps yet!** ⚠️

- The code will throw an error if we try to fit any of our logit models due to the absence of dummies.  
- Besides, the Lasso model would perform poorly due to the differently scaled predictors.  
- Likewise, the tree model will always predict the negative class due to the severe class imbalance.

After fitting the model, we can eventually predict the response in the test data.

**`tidymodels` prediction rules:**
1. Predictions are returned as a `tibble` (no need to extract predictions from an object).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2. Column names are predictable (`.pred`, `.pred_class`, `.pred_lower`/`.pred_upper`, etc. depending on the prediction `type`).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3. The number of predictions equals the number of data points in `new_data` (and is in the same order).

???
- leading dots protect against merging errors based on identical column names

## 4.3 `parsnip`: A Unified Modeling API

Thanks to these rules, we can directly combine the predictions with the `test_set`.

## 4.4 `workflows`: Modeling Workflows

`workflows` introduces a `workflow` object which bundles the preprocessing recipe and model specification to reduce code clatter. At the same time, it acts as a single entry point to your modeling pipeline.

cls_wf &lt;- workflow(preprocessor = mod_recipe, spec = log_cls)
cls_wf

.pull-right[.pull-right[.footnote[
*Note: You may even bundle (and later explore) various different combinations of preprocessing recipes and model specifications using the `workflowsets` package.*
]]]

???
- if no preprocessing is required (because the data is already perfect) `add_formula()` could be used (but you can only ever use one of the two)
- in later releases, `workflows` should also be able to encapsulate post-processing steps (e.g., modifying the probability cutoff for binary classification; or calibration of probabilities; or determination of euqivocal zones)

---

## 4.4 `workflows`: Modeling Workflows

When calling `fit()` on a `workflow` object, `tidymodels` performs the following steps for us:
1. It fits the `recipe` object to the training set and produces the in-sample estimates (`prep()`).
2. It applies the fitted recipe to the training set to process the predictors (`bake()`).
3. It trains the specified model on the transformed training set (`fit()`/`fit_xy()`).


```r
cls_wf_fit &lt;- cls_wf %&gt;% 
  fit(train_set)

cls_wf_fit
```
```

- workflows abstract away the need for `prep` and `bake`

## 4.5 `dials`: Creating Hyperparameter Values

Most machine learning models require the user to predefine so-called **hyperparameters** (or *tuning parameters*) prior to model fitting. For example:
- **Linear regression:** -
- **Logistic regression:** -
- **Linear discriminant analysis:** -
- **Regularized regression:** `penalty`, `mixture`
- **Naïve bayes:** `Laplace`
- **k-nearest-neighbor:** `neighbors`, `weight_func`, `dist_power` 
- **CART:** `cost_complexity`, `tree_depth`, `min_n`
- **SVM:** `kernel`, `cost`, `degree`, `scale_factor`
- **Bagging:** `trees`, `min_n`
- **Random forest:** `trees`, `mtry`, `min_n`
- **Boosting:** `trees`, `mtry`, `min_n`, `tree_depth`, `learn_rate`

.footnote[
*Note: This list is not exhaustive! Depending on the underlying engine, an even broader set of hyperparameters can be specified. Use `args()` to inspect all hyperparameters (i.e. function arguments) available in a `parsnip` object.*
]

???
- hyperparameters cannot be learned from the data (which is why they differ from model coefficients/weights) -&gt; they are external to model training
- NB: Laplace correction for smoothing low-frequency counts.
- CART: cost complexity for pruning as well as max tree depth, min_n for minimum number of data points to allow another split
- svm: scale_factor = gamma -&gt; determines the influence of a single data point on the decision boundary
- boosting: learn_rate -&gt; speed with which the boosted tree adapts to the fitted errors

---

## 4.5 `dials`: Creating Hyperparameter Values

`dials` streamlines the handling of hyperparameters. It provides functions for specifying parameter sequences and grids, introduces `parameters` objects that can be processed by the `parsnip` package, and ensures consistent parameter names.

--

In the context of a regularized regression, `penalty` and `mixture` are the two central hyperparameters. `dials` comes with a predefined `parameters` object for both.

## Excursus: Hyperparameter Scales

In practice, you will find that hyperparameters are often defined on the log instead of the original linear scale, as for example seen on the previous slide:
- **`mixture()`:** `\(0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0\)`
- **`penalty()`:** `\(1e^{-10}, 1e^{-9}, 1e^{-8}, 1e^{-7}, 1e^{-6}, 1e^{-5}, 1e^{-4}, 1e^{-3}, 1e^{-2}, 1e^{-1}, 1e^{0}\)`

--

**Considerations for using the Log-Scale:**

1. If you have no clue regarding the optimal parameter value, you are inclined to evaluate a broad search space with relatively small but also relatively large candidate values (e.g., from `\(1e^{-10}\)` to `\(1\)`). On a linear scale, this approach would ignore a large proportion of the relatively small search space. For example the region `\([0, 0.1]\)` on the linear scale includes all most all candidates from the log-scale.
2. For some models and hyperparameter sets, the model's accuracy is relatively insensitive to certain regions of the search space. Those models demand a large variation in order to observe any impact on the underlying performance metrics.

--

If you have identified a promising parameter subspace, you may eventually narrow it down by further restricting the search space of your hyperparameter grid.

???
- usually models do not behave linear in the hyperparameters (i.e. some are very sensitive on low regions and some are more sensitive in high regions)

## 4.5 `dials`: Creating Hyperparameter Values

There are special cases where the concrete hyperparameter values depend on your data set, e.g., the `mtry` argument (number of randomly sampled predictors at each split) in `parsnip::rand_forest()`.

```r
mtry()
```

```
&gt; # Randomly Selected Predictors (quantitative)
&gt; Range: [1, ?]
```

Therefore, we must `finalize()` the hyperparameter setup based on the training set.

```r
finalize(mtry(), x = train_set %&gt;% select(-died))
```

```
&gt; # Randomly Selected Predictors (quantitative)
&gt; Range: [1, 12]

- **Bayesian Optimization:** Evaluate new candidates, for example, based on the regions of the search space with high uncertainty (*exploration*) or high expected improvement (*exploitation*) ([Agnihotri/Batra, 2020](https://distill.pub/2020/bayesian-optimization/)).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- **Simulated Annealing:** Evaluate new, randomly sampled candidates that are in close proximity to the current best candidate. If the new candidate is superior, continue from there, otherwise return to current optimum ([Kuhn/Silge, 2021](https://www.tmwr.org/iterative-search.html#simulated-annealing)).

- Random Search:
  - Pro: Randomness can help to find global optimum
  - Con: Can produce overlapping candidates
- Racing: perform interim analysis
  - Pro: good for computationally expensive models (e.g., DNN, SVM)
  - Contra: interim t-tests inefficient for relatively efficient methods (e.g., tree-based models)
- SA: returning the previous best is more probably if new candidate is significantly weaker
  - Pro: good with very large number of tuning parameters due to random components

```

.footnote[
*Note: Using the `tune()` placeholder, we could even tune hyperparameters that are part of our modeling recipes (e.g., `over_ratio` in `themis::step_upsample()` or `threshold` in `step_other`).*
]

???
- mixture determines how much of the LASSO vs. ridge penalty is included in the loss function

## Tidymodels: A Complete Tuning Example

**Step 5:** Bring everything together using `workflows`.

```r
cls_wf &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%
  add_recipe(rec) %&gt;%
  add_model(reg_log_cls)
```

**Step 6:** Create a grid of hyperparameter candidates for performing a grid search.

```r
param_grid &lt;- grid_regular(
  penalty(), mixture(),
  levels = c(10, 10)
)

param_grid %&gt;% 
  glimpse
```

```
&gt; Rows: 100
&gt; Columns: 2
&gt; $ penalty &lt;dbl&gt; 1.000000e-10, 1.291550e-09, 1.668101e-08, 2.154435e-07, 2.782559e-06~
&gt; $ mixture &lt;dbl&gt; 0.0000000, 0.0000000, 0.0000000, 0.0000000, 0.0000000, 0.0000000, 0.~
```

---

## Tidymodels: A Complete Tuning Example

**Step 7:** Perform hyperparameter tuning using `tune`.

`tune_grid()` iterates over all 10 folds included in `climbers_folds`, and evaluates all 100 candidate pairs for `mixture()` and `penalty()` in `param_grid`, resulting in 1,000 model fits.

```r

  grid = param_grid,
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc, accuracy, sens, spec),
  control = control_grid(save_pred = T, verbose = T)
)

Sys.time() - start
```

```
&gt; Time difference of 8.985842 mins
```

.footnote[
*Note: If we are not concerned with hyperparameter tuning per sé, but simply want to train a model without hyperparameters and obtain an unbiased performance estimate, we can refer to `fit_resamples()` which works almost identical to `tune_grid()` (except for the `grid` argument).*
]

---

## Excursus: Parallel Processing

**Problem:** Depending on your hardware, your dataset size, your model and the amount of hyperparameters to be optimized, the search process can take several minutes, hours or even days.

**Solution:** `tune` is equipped with distributed computing capabilities (which stem from an integration of the [`foreach` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/foreach/vignettes/foreach.html)). The tuning process allows for models to be trained independent of each other along multiple dimensions:
- parallelization across resamples,
- parallelization across hyperparameter candidates, or
- parallelization within ensemble models (e.g., random forest or boosted trees).

---

## Excursus: Parallel Processing

**Step 7a:** Check the number of available CPU cores.

```r
all_cores &lt;- parallel::detectCores(logical = F)
all_cores
```

```
&gt; [1] 6
```

???
- **Physical cores** are number of physical cores, actual hardware components.
- **Logical cores** are the number of physical cores times the number of possible simultaneous processes.

--

**Step 7b:** Create a cluster of workers, i.e. `R` sessions run in parallel. In the background, `tune` divides your data (e.g., resamples) and distributes it across the available clusters.

```r
comp_cluster &lt;- parallel::makeCluster(all_cores - 2)
comp_cluster
```

```
&gt; Socketcluster mit 4 Knoten auf System 'localhost'
```

???
tip: its generally a good idea to not use all available clusters
  - oftentimes, performance increases are not linear but you get a rate of diminishing returns
  - the memory load is proportional as copies of your data are transferred to every core
  - you still want to be able to work on your computer while the computations are executed
  - there are scenarios in which parallel computing can even be detrimental (large dataset, simple model)

--

**Step 7c:** Register a backend for parallel computing (here the `doParallel` package). The backend handles the parallelization (e.g., load balancing ensures that cores are not "underemployed").

```r
doParallel::registerDoParallel(comp_cluster)
```

---

## Excursus: Parallel Processing

**Step 7d:** Perform hyperparameter tuning in parallel using `tune`.

&lt;img src="https://tenor.com/view/yay-traffic-car-race-gif-14739892.gif" width="35%" height="35%" style="float:right; padding: 30px" /&gt;


```r
start &lt;- Sys.time()

cls_wf_fit &lt;- tune_grid(
  cls_wf, climbers_folds,
  grid = param_grid,
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc, accuracy, sens, spec),
  control = control_grid(
    save_pred = T, verbose = T,
    allow_par = T, parallel_over = "resamples", pkgs = c('themis')
  )
)

Sys.time() - start
```
```
&gt; Time difference of 3.706945 mins
```

.footnote[
*Note: By default, `tidymodels` copies only its core packages to all concurrently running `R` sessions. If you leverage additional packages (e.g., `themis`) as part of your modeling pipeline, it must be provided in the tuning controls.*
]

???
- there are different backends packages that you can use for parallel processing. They start with `do` and vary in the way of how they enable parallel processing.
- as you can see the speed-up is not proportional but diminishing in the number of cores (also somewhat depending on what you are doing in the background)

## 4.6 `tune`: Tidy Tuning Tools

`tune_grid()` updates your initial `climbers_folds` object by adding additional columns (`.metrics` and `.notes`, `.predictions` and others depending on your controls).

```r
cls_wf_fit
```

```
&gt; # Tuning results

```

Now, there are several neat things we can do with our fitted `climbers_folds` data frame. Let's have a look at some convenience functions provided by the `tune` package.

???
- note that the resulting tibble does neither include the data (only the indexes) nor the fitted models, but only the performance metrics and predictions (usually we are not interested in the models themselves during resampling, but only in the optimal hyperparameter set)
- .notes captures warnings and errors that occur during execution to help you debugging (i.e. which model and fold potentially produced an error)
- most of the columns `tidymodels` creates have the "." prefix in order to not override initial columns

## 4.6 `tune`: Tidy Tuning Tools

We have now successfully tuned a single machine learning model! 🤗 🤩 Eventually, however, we would like multiple models to compete on a given task and choose the winner. 🥇

&lt;br&gt;

**Practical Tips for Model Selection ([Kuhn/Johnson (2013), p. 79](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/)):** 
1. Start with very flexible *black-box* models (e.g., boosted trees or SVM) to produce an optimal benchmark (*performance ceiling*).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2. Evaluate slightly less opaque models which provide a baseline degree of interpretability (e.g., PLS, PCA or regularized regression).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3. Try out a parsimonious *white-box* model (e.g., linear regression or CART) and investigate if it can reasonably approximate the performance ceiling.

## 4.7 `broom`: Tidy Model Outputs

`broom` provides three useful functions for converting `parsnip` objects (e.g., `lm`, `glm`, `rpart`) into tidy `tibbles`:
- `tidy()`: produces a tidy output of model components (e.g., coefficients, weights, clusters)
- `glance()`: produces a tidy output of model summaries (e.g., goodness-of-fit, `\(F\)` - statistics)
- `augment()`: adds additional information about observations (e.g., fitted values, residuals)

&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/broom_package.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???
- difference to `tidyr`: these functions tidy model objects, `tidyr` is all about tidying and transforming data frames

---

## 4.7 `broom`: Tidy Model Outputs

In order to illustrate the convenience of the three `broom` functions, let us first extract our optimal model from `cls_wf_results`.


```r

.panel[.panel-name[augment()]
**`augment()`** adds additional information about observations (e.g., fitted values, residuals)

Unfortunately, `augment()` is not supported for `glmnet` models (check [available methods](https://broom.tidymodels.org/articles/available-methods.html)).
]
]

.footnote[
*Note: Depending on the class of the model object you are providing to `tidy()`, it offers several advanced features, such as returning odds-ratios for logit-models (`exponentiate = T`) or confidence interval (`conf.int = T`).*
]

???
- `tidy`: useful for creating visualizations or preparing model tables for a paper
- `glance`:
  - useful for investigating overall model performance
  - identify mis-specifications
  - compare models in general
  
- these functions are implemented with the need of data scientist in mind, i.e. what are the statistics the modeler is most likely interested in?
- they also work with techniques from classical statistics such as t-tests

## 4.8 `yardstick`: Tidy Model Performance

Similar to `broom`, `yardstick`'s endeavor is to enable model evaluation using *tidy data principles*. It provides various performance metrics for both, classification and regression problems.

- **Class metrics for classification:** Metrics that are computed based on the predicted classes (*hard predictions*) and take two `fct` columns (`truth` and `estimate`) as input.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- **Class probability metrics for classification:** Metrics that are computed based on the predicted class probabilities (*soft predictions*) and take one `fct` column (`truth`) and one/multiple `dbl` columns (`estimate`) as input.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- **Numeric metrics for regression:** Metrics that are computed based on a numerical prediction and take two `dbl` columns (`truth` and `estimate`) as input.

.footnote[
*Note: Find all available metrics grouped by their type on [tidymodels.org](https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/articles/metric-types.html#metrics) or learn more about the `yardstick` package, e.g., about features for multi-class learning problems, in [Kuhn/Silge (2021)](https://www.tmwr.org/performance.html).*

???
- "binary" indicates that the measures are computed for a binary classification problem
- for multi-class problems `yardstick` has implemented generalizations of the original measures
- you already know the metric_set from `tune_grid()` where we specified the metrics that we want to compute during our resampling approach

class probability metrics: we provide the probability column for the event of interest

Multiple Roc-Curves:
- yardsticks functions have a consistent API that allows to easily operate on grouped data
- ideally you would not only want to compare the model performance for different folds but also across models -&gt; this is straightforward with `yardstick` as well

## Excursus: Alternative Evaluation Dimensions

- **Scalability:** How well does the model scale to larger data sets? Is the speed of model re-training and prediction adversely affected in a real-time scenario?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- **Robustness**: Is the model robust against perturbations (e.g., missing values or outliers) in the unseen data? Does the performance deteriorate rapidly in the context of data drift?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- **Transferability:** Can the model be applied to related tasks without substantial re-training of the model and without a substantial loss of predictive accuracy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- **Interpretability:** Are predictions explainable? Can the relationship between a predictor and the outcome be extracted from the model?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- **Fairness &amp; Compliance:** Does the model systematically discriminate against certain sub-populations or ethical groups? Does it comply with prevalent law in a given domain?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- **Justifiability:** Are the predictions in line with well-known business rules? Are the most important predictors consistent with prior beliefs?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- **Causality:** Does the model allow causal inference? If no, does it enable the user to generate hypotheses that can be tested using alternative statistical approaches?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

## 5 Additions to the `tidymodels` Ecosystem

Similar to the `tidyverse` ecosystem, there is already a promising supply of complementary packages that further improve the capabilities of `tidymodels`, e.g.:

&lt;img src="https://tenor.com/view/shocked-po-kung-fu-panda-gif-4255877.gif" width="40%" height="40%" style="float:right; padding: 30px" /&gt;

- `textrecipes`: Extra recipes for text processing
- `baguette`: Efficient model functions for bagging
- `stacks`: Tidy model stacking
- `probably`: Tools for post-processing class probability estimates
- `infer`: Statistical inference and hypothesis testing using tidy data principles
- `finetune`: Implementation of additional search algorithms
- `usemodels`: Boilerplate code for `tidymodels` analyses


???
- textrecipes as extension to the recipes package for natural language processing
- baguette as add-on to the parsnip package
- stacking: ensemble technique to integrate the predictions of multiple models into a meta-model
- probably enables the identification of optimal probability thresholds and equivocal zones (uncertain probability regions)
- infer:

## 5 Additions to the `tidymodels` Ecosystem

**`usemodels`:** Boilerplate code for `tidymodels` analyses


```r
library(usemodels)
ls("package:usemodels", pattern = "use_")
```

```
&gt; [1] "use_cubist"  "use_earth"   "use_glmnet"  "use_kknn"    "use_ranger" 
&gt; [6] "use_xgboost"
```
&lt;br&gt;

For example, `use_glmnet` generates a code blueprint for a regularized logistic classifier.

```r
use_glmnet(died ~ ., data = climbers_df, verbose = F, prefix = "glmnet_mod")
```
```
&gt;  Output on next slide
```

## 5 Additions to the `tidymodels` Ecosystem


```
&gt; glmnet_mod_recipe &lt;- 
&gt;   recipe(formula = died ~ ., data = climbers_df) %&gt;% 
&gt;   step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %&gt;% 
&gt;   step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %&gt;% 
&gt;   step_zv(all_predictors()) %&gt;% 
&gt;   step_normalize(all_predictors(), -all_nominal()) 
&gt; 
&gt; glmnet_mod_spec &lt;- 
&gt;   logistic_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = tune()) %&gt;% 
&gt;   set_mode("classification") %&gt;% 
&gt;   set_engine("glmnet") 
&gt; 
&gt; glmnet_mod_workflow &lt;- 
&gt;   workflow() %&gt;% 
&gt;   add_recipe(glmnet_mod_recipe) %&gt;% 
&gt;   add_model(glmnet_mod_spec) 
&gt; 
&gt; glmnet_mod_grid &lt;- tidyr::crossing(penalty = 10^seq(-6, -1, length.out = 20), 
&gt;     mixture = c(0.05, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1)) 
&gt; 
&gt; glmnet_mod_tune &lt;- 
&gt;   tune_grid(glmnet_mod_workflow, resamples = stop("add your rsample object"), 
&gt;     grid = glmnet_mod_grid)
```

???
- `verbose = T` adds some additional comments for why some of the feature engineering steps are included
- recipe template contains minimal required steps
- proposed tuning grid might not be the best for your specific use case
- the template urges the user to manually specify the resampling method
